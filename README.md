# Coin Change Calculator

## Description
This program calculates the minimum number of coins required to make a given amount of change using standard US currency denominations (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies). It employs a greedy algorithm to always use the largest possible coin first, ensuring the fewest coins are used.
